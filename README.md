üå°Ô∏è LSTM Air Temperature Predictor

This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast air temperature from historical time-series data. It covers the full workflow, starting with data preprocessing using Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, followed by model development with TensorFlow/Keras, where techniques such as Dropout and BatchNormalization are applied to improve generalization. Training is enhanced with callbacks like EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and ModelCheckpoint to optimize performance. The model is evaluated with metrics including MSE, MAE, and R¬≤, and results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear interpretation. This project demonstrates practical applications in weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and general time-series prediction tasks, showcasing how deep learning can be applied to real-world data.
